\begin{abstract}
Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments. However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots. Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence. Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed \textbf{En}tropy-scaled \textbf{S}teering vectors for \textbf{To}pic \textbf{M}aintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems\footnote{The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/linkyouhj/enstom}}.

\section{Introduction}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of sophisticated conversational systems across a wide range of services~\cite{naveed2024comprehensiveoverviewlargelanguage}. These systems are increasingly being adopted by organizations for applications such as customer support, conversational assitants, and internal process guidance. However, openly available API-based large-scale models often face limitations in terms of compliance with strict data privacy policies and security regulations. Furthermore, large-scale open-source models demand significant computational resources, which results in high operational costs for deployment. In this context, sLLMs have emerged as a practical alternative~\cite{10.1145/3589334.3645420} by offering lightweight and resource-efficient solutions for production environments. Since these models enable organizations to achieve robust conversational capabilities without the extensive computational costs associated with larger models, they are a compelling choice for a variety of applications.

  \label{fig:first}
\end{figure}

Despite their impressive performance on general tasks, LLMs face challenges when deployed in real-world scenarios that demand consistent maintenance of specific constraints like business contexts, or scenario-driven dialogues \cite{sreedhar-etal-2024-canttalkaboutthis}. This issue becomes especially pronounced with sLLMs~\cite{doi:10.1073/pnas.2311878121}, as their limited capacity makes it even harder to ensure scenario consistency over extended user interactions (Figure~\ref{fig:first}). The inability to maintain a prescribed scenario directly undermines a service chatbot’s intended functionality; if it cannot adhere to a given workflow, policy, or domain rule, it fails to deliver the expected user experience, which potentially leads to misinformation, reduced trustworthiness, and even safety concerns such as inadvertently disclosing sensitive information~\cite{10.5555/3666122.3667033}. Consequently, the capability of an LLM to reliably uphold scenario constraints and follow specified directives is not merely an enhancement but a necessity in real-world applications. 

Numerous alignment techniques have been proposed to address this issue, with two prominent approaches being fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Fine-tuning the model with domain-specific, high-quality data can effectively realign its internal parameters to suit particular constraints. However, this process demands substantial resources in terms of data collection, annotation, and computational cost, which makes it impractical in covering every possible scenario. Meanwhile, prompt engineering techniques offer a more lightweight and less resource-intensive solution. While prompt-based methods have demonstrated efficacy in steering model behavior, their effectiveness often diminishes in complex, nuanced scenarios~\cite{Patel2023TheLO} where detailed instructions and long-term context-maintenance are required.

In light of these limitations, there is a clear need for new, more flexible methods that can help LLMs to consistently maintain scenario adherence without incurring the substantial overhead of extensive fine-tuning or relying solely on prompt design.
To this end, we propose a novel and lightweight approach termed \textbf{En}tropy-scaled \textbf{S}teering vectors for \textbf{To}pic \textbf{M}aintenance (EnSToM) based on \textit{activation addition}, which steers a model’s generation at inference time without altering its parameters. By injecting a carefully derived \textit{steering vector} into the model’s intermediate activations, we can gently nudge the LLM towards maintaining scenario consistency. However, our preliminary experiment showed that straightforward application of \textit{activation addition} cause undesired steering even for on-topic inputs, potentially degrading the user experience or interfering with correct responses.

To address this, we introduce \textit{entropy-based coefficient scaling} that leverages intrinsic model signals—specifically, layer-wise generation entropy—to differentiate between on-topic and distractor inputs. This is motivated by our key observation that the entropy distribution varies depending on whether the input is on-topic or a distractor. By dynamically adjusting the steering vector’s strength based on this entropy information, our method is able to enforce scenario adherence more diligently for distractor inputs while preserving the model’s natural behavior for on-topic interactions.

This approach offers a resource-efficient alignment strategy that can enhance existing prompt-based methods without the need for extensive retraining or exhaustive scenario-specific data collection. In this paper, we detail the design of our method, present an in-depth analysis of its performance, and demonstrate its ability to promote scenario adherence while minimizing adverse effects on normal inputs. Our main contributions can therefore be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose \textbf{EnSToM}, a novel and lightweight \textit{activation addition}-based method with entropy-based scaling that dynamically adjusts the steering vector’s influence. This ensures robust topic maintenance for distractor input while preserving on-topic accuracy.
    \item Experiments on the CantTalkAboutThis dataset show that EnSToM significantly improves topic adherence in task-oriented dialogues.
    \item We conduct a comprehensive analysis of entropy patterns in LLMs by investigating layer-wise entropy distributions across on-topic and distractor inputs. Our findings provide key insights into the intrinsic properties of LLMs in different scenarios, which inform the design of entropy-aware steering strategies.
\end{itemize}
\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Steering Vectors}

Steering vectors~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-10248, rimsky-etal-2024-steering} modify hidden states by computing differences between desirable and undesirable responses. As this allows for targeted activation adjustments, steering vectors have been explored for Trojan Activation Attacks~\cite{10.1145/3627673.3679821}, and behavior alignment without fine-tuning~\cite{subramani-etal-2022-extracting}. In another domain, \citet{lee2024programmingrefusalconditionalactivation} leverages conditioning vectors to selectively control model behavior based on input contexts, while \citet{stickland2024steering} introduces KL-Then-Steer (KTS) training to mitigate performance degradation during steering vector application. Building on these findings, our approach enhances robustness by incorporating internal layer-wise entropy of language models, ensuring consistent distractor accuracy without degrading on-topic performance.


\subsection{Topic-Following Dialogue System}

Topic adherence in dialogue systems has been explored through various approaches. \citet{zhan-etal-2021-scope} improved out-of-scope intent detection via pseudo outliers, while \citet{mu2024llmsfollowsimplerules} introduced the RuLES benchmark to assess rule-following behavior. Instruction fine-tuning for safety was explored in Llama Guard~\cite{inan2023llamaguardllmbasedinputoutput}, whereas \citet{xu-etal-2024-safedecoding} and \citet{xie-etal-2024-gradsafe} proposed decoding and gradient-based alignment strategies. Moreover, \citet{sreedhar-etal-2024-canttalkaboutthis} curated the CantTalkAboutThis dataset for evaluating on-topic dialogue and distractor handling. We leverage this dataset to improve both distractor and on-topic query accuracy.

\section{Preliminaries}

This section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and methodologies that form the basis of our approach towards maintaining topic consistency in task-oriented dialogues. It also includes a brief description of the source dataset and the methodology for extracting steering vectors.

\subsection{Topic Maintenance in Dialogue System}
The CantTalkAboutThis~\cite{sreedhar-etal-2024-canttalkaboutthis} source dataset is designed to evaluate how language models handle off-topic queries in multi-domain dialogues. Each data sample is represented as \( X = \{I, D, u\} \), where \( I \) denotes the system instruction, \( D \) represents the dialogue history, and \( u \) is the user input query, which can be either on-topic (\( o \)) or off-topic (\( d \)). This structure allows for the systematic analysis of a model's ability in maintaining task-oriented scenarios with strict adherence to predefined topics. 


\subsection{Steering Vector}\label{steering_vector_concept}
Steering vectors~\cite{rimsky-etal-2024-steering} guide the model's responses toward desired behaviors without requiring additional training. The core concept involves leveraging differences in the hidden representations of a language model at a specific layer to align its outputs with predefined scenarios. Specifically, for any input pair \( q_i = \{q^p_i, q^n_i\} \) (where \( p \) denotes desired behavior and \( n \) denotes undesired behavior), we compute the hidden representations \( h^{(l)} \) at a designated layer \( l \) through a forward pass \( f(\cdot) \). An example of such a pair is illustrated in the upper half of Figure~\ref{fig:main}. Additionally, the representations \( h_p^{(l)} \) and \( h_n^{(l)} \) correspond to the activations for the desired behavioral completion letter (\( c_p \)) and the undesired behavioral completion letter (\( c_n \)), respectively. Note that the completion letter represents the designated choice of either A or B in a multiple-choice response format. The steering vector for \( q_i \) can then be computed as:
\[
v_s^i = h_p^{(l)} - h_n^{(l)}.
\]
Given \( k \) pairs in the dataset, the final steering vector \( v \) is computed by averaging the individual steering vectors. Subsequently, these vectors are normalized to ensure consistent scaling across behaviors. Formally, let the norm of each \( v_s^i \) be denoted as \( \|v_s^i\| \), and let the average norm across all \( k \) vectors be \( \bar{\|v\|} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \|v_s^i\| \). The normalized steering vector is obtained as \(\text{norm}(v_s^i) = v_s^i \cdot \frac{\bar{\|v\|}}{\|v_s^i\|}\). The process of computing the final steering vector \(v\) is summarized as follows:
\[
v =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \text{norm}\left(v_s^i \right).
\]

This aggregated vector \( v \) is applied to adjust the model's activations during inference, which nudges its behavior toward the desired direction. Steering vectors thus offer an efficient mechanism to enforce topic consistency without requiring additional fine-tuning or training.

\label{tab:preliminary}
\end{table}


\section{Proposed Methodology}
According to preliminary experiments (Table~\ref{tab:preliminary}), we are able to observe that uniform application of the steering vector \( v \) improves distractor refusal accuracy but significantly degrades responses to on-topic inputs. This degradation is likely attributable to the consistent guidance of the steering vector towards refusal, regardless of whether the input is on- or off-topic. Since preserving on-topic performance is as crucial as enhancing refusal capability, a more adaptive approach is required.

Therefore, in order to improve scenario adherence in task-oriented dialogue systems by dynamically steering model responses based on input entropy, we propose an approach which is comprised of three main components: (1) extracting steering vectors to align model behavior with predefined scenarios, (2) applying an entropy-based coefficient scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, and (3) generating responses using these scaled steering vectors. By combining these components, our method effectively addresses the challenge of maintaining topic consistency in task-oriented dialogues, even amid off-topic distractors. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:main}.


\subsection{Steering Vector Extraction}
From the source dataset, we first construct the \texttt{Steering QA Dataset} \( S = \{q_1, q_2, \dots\} \), which is utilized to extract the steering vector using the method described in Section~\ref{steering_vector_concept}. Specifically, each \( q_i \) represents a pair of prompts derived from the same distractor query \( d \). For each \( d \), the distractor is paired with two choice options explicitly representing a desired behavior and an undesired behavior. These options provide clear examples of a \textit{refusal response} that redirects the conversation back to the topic, and an \textit{engaging response} that inappropriately responds to the distractor. 

In this setup, each refusal response (\( q^p_i\)) and engaging response (\(q^n_i\)) end with a different completion letter: one where the desired behavior completion letter (\( c_p \); e.g. A) is selected, and another where the undesired behavior completion letter (\( c_n \); e.g. B) is chosen. The refusal and engaging choices are randomly assigned across all test inputs to prevent positional bias in the evaluation. This structure enables the explicit differentiation needed for steering vector extraction. Note that since the CantTalkAboutThis source dataset lacks diverse refusal and engaging responses, these were generated using GPT-4o\footnote{\url{https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o}}~\cite{openai2024gpt4ocard}. Full details of the prompt designs for generating completions are provided in the Appendix~\ref{sec:prompt}.

In order to extract the steering vector from the newly constructed \texttt{Steering QA Dataset}, we perform a forward pass \( f(\cdot) \) through the pre-trained language model for each pair \( q_i \in S \). At a designated layer \( l \), we compute the hidden representations \( h_{p}^{(l)} \) for \( c_p \) and \( h_{n}^{(l)} \) for \( c_n \). Using the theoretical definition in Section~\ref{steering_vector_concept}, the steering vector \( v \) is derived by averaging and normalizing the differences in activations across all pairs. During inference, the steering vector is applied to ensure the model's outputs remain consistent with the topic.



\subsection{Entropy-Based Coefficient Scaling}
Recent studies~\cite{chen2024inside,ji-etal-2024-llm,azaria-mitchell-2023-internal,chuang2024dola} have demonstrated that LLM internal states can be leveraged for reliable generation. Inspired by these findings, we conduct preliminary investigations regarding LLM internal states. Experimental results (Figures~\ref{fig:entropy_violin} and \ref{fig:mean_domain_layer}) reveal that under the same system instruction, the entropy distribution of each layer differs between distractor and on-topic inputs. This observation suggests that layer-wise entropy can serve as a discriminator between the two input types. Based on this insight, we introduce an entropy-based coefficient scaling method, which is detailed in Sections~\ref{sec:layer_entropy_analysis} and~\ref{sec:scaling}.


\subsubsection{Layer-Wise Entropy Analysis}\label{sec:layer_entropy_analysis}
We define the entropy \( E^{(l)}_d \text{ and } E^{(l)}_o \) at layer \( l \) for the inputs \( x_d = \{I, D, d\} \text{ and } x_o = \{I, D, o\} \), where \(o\) and \(d\) denote the on-topic and distractor user queries, respectively, during the generation of \( k=2 \) tokens. For each output token, the entropy \( E^{(l)}\) is computed as follows: 
\[
E^{(l)} = \mathbb{E}\left[- \sum_{i=1}^{V} p_i^{(l)} \log \left(p_i^{(l)} + \epsilon\right) \right],
\]
\[
p_i^{(l)} = \frac{\exp(z_i^{(l)})}{\sum_{j=1}^{V} \exp(z_j^{(l)})}.
\]
Here, $V$ denotes the size of the vocabulary. For a given layer \( l \), \( p_i^{(l)} \) is the probability of the \( i \)-th token, which is obtained using the softmax function applied to the logits \( z_i^{(l)} \). Moreover, \( z_i^{(l)} \) represents the logit of the model for the \( i \)-th token at layer \( l \). The constant \( \epsilon \) is a small value of \( 10^{-12} \), which is added to ensure numerical stability when computing the logarithm of the probabilities. The entropy at layer \( l \) quantifies the uncertainty of the token probabilities and is averaged across all inputs in the batch. We compute entropy as the average over the two tokens because the first token (e.g., \(<s>\)) typically carries minimal variation (\( \text{entropy} \approx 0 \)) due to its role as the generation start token.

    \caption{Comparison of entropy distribution in different layers of Llama-2-7b-chat.}

\end{figure}

We observe significant differences in entropy distributions between distractor and on-topic inputs at layers 16 and 19 (Figures~\ref{fig:entropy_violin} and~\ref{fig:mean_domain_layer}). While both layers exhibit clear distributional differences, the relative entropy values vary by layer; on-topic inputs show higher entropy in some layers (Figure~\ref{fig:entropy_violin_16}), whereas distractor inputs have higher entropy in others (Figure~\ref{fig:entropy_violin_19}). Notably, as seen in Figures~\ref{fig:entropy_violin_16} and~\ref{fig:entropy_violin_19}, the distinction at layer 16 is more pronounced. The implications of these differences on experimental outcomes are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}, while a detailed analysis of the observed entropy patterns is provided in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. Based on these findings, we select layers 16 and 19 as \( L \), where \( L \) represents the LLM layers used for entropy extraction.

\subsubsection{Implementation of Entropy-Based Coefficient Scaling}\label{sec:scaling}
We introduce a coefficient scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust the steering intensity based on input entropy. The scaling coefficient is defined as:
\[
C_H^{(L)} = \frac{C_{\text{max}}}{1 + e^{-\alpha \delta (H^{(L)} - t)}},
\]
where \( C_H^{(L)} \) is the entropy-based scaling coefficient, and the entropy at layer \(L\) of the model's response to the user query is denoted as \( H^{(L)} \). The maximum coefficient \( C_{\text{max}} \) is set to 1.5 based on prior findings by \citet{rimsky-etal-2024-steering}\footnote{For further analysis of coefficient scaling, see Appendix~\ref{sec:coefficient}.}. The slope parameter \( \alpha \), which controls the steepness of the sigmoid function, is set to 5, while the threshold entropy \( t \) is empirically set to 7.5.

In order to adjust the scaling direction based on entropy differences between distractor and on-topic inputs, the parameter \(\delta\) is set to -1 when the average entropy of distractors is lower than on-topic inputs (Layer 16) and \(+1\) when it is higher (Layer 19). This adjustment ensures that the coefficient increases when the entropy deviates from \( t \) in the appropriate direction. By dynamically modulating the coefficient, this approach enhances refusal accuracy for distractor inputs while preserving engaging responses for on-topic interactions.

    \caption{Effect of entropy-based scaling at different thresholds $t$.}
    \label{fig:threshold}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Response Generation}
During response generation, the model processes an input consisting of system instructions (\(I\)), dialogue history (\(D\)), and the user question (either off-topic \(d\) or on-topic \(o\)). The model then generates \(k=2\) tokens using greedy decoding, during which the entropy value (\(H\)) is computed at layers 16 and 19.

This entropy value is used to calculate the coefficient via the entropy-based coefficient scaling mechanism outlined in Section~\ref{sec:scaling}. The computed coefficient is applied to the steering vector ($v$), which is added to the model's activations at a designated layer ($h^{(l)}$). Note that this layer is distinct from the layer that is used for entropy extraction:
\[
{h'}^{(l)} = h^{(l)} + C_H^{(L)}\cdot v
\]
This process ensures that the steering intensity dynamically adapts to the input's entropy, which enhances the model's ability to handle distractors while maintaining accuracy on on-topic inputs.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We conduct our main experiments using LLaMA-2-7B-Chat~\cite{touvron2023llama2openfoundation} and Minstral-8B-Instruct-2410\footnote{\url{https://mistral.ai/en/news/ministraux}} to evaluate the generalizability of our method. Both models are executed on a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU, and do not involve additional training; instead, they focus on extracting steering vectors and computing entropy. Steering is applied at layers 13-16 since the middle layers are more effective at modifying generation behavior \cite{rimsky-etal-2024-steering}.


We evaluate our method on the CantTalkAboutThis dataset~\cite{sreedhar-etal-2024-canttalkaboutthis}, which spans 10 domains. Our experiments focus on the banking domain, which consists of 60 independent scenarios with 10 to 15 samples each. To prevent data contamination, we use 100 samples\footnote{Extended experimental results with varying sample sizes are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:add_ex}.} from 10 scenarios to compute steering vectors, and keep them separate from the test set, which includes 550 samples each for distractor and on-topic cases. Evaluation was conducted separately for distractor and on-topic settings. Detailed dataset statistics are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:detail_source}. For evaluation, we use GPT-4o to classify model responses as refusals or engaging responses. The prompts used for evaluation are detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:prompt_eval}.


% JailbreakBench: An Open Robustness Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Language Models => use LLaMA-70B as refusal judge
% Human evaluation was not conducted, as GPT-4o has been shown to reliably assess whether a response constitutes a refusal, ensuring sufficient accuracy for this task.
\paragraph{Metric} 
\label{para:metric}
We evaluate the model's performance using two accuracy metrics: (1) \textbf{Distractor accuracy}, which is defined as the proportion of responses where the model correctly refuses off-topic content, and (2) \textbf{On-topic accuracy}, which is the proportion of responses where the model appropriately engages with relevant content without refusing.

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:results}

Table~\ref{tab:main} compares the performance of EnSToM across layers 13 to 16 under two entropy extraction settings, \( L = 16 \) and \( L = 19 \), against the baseline \textit{Prompt Only} method. In all conditions, we use a fixed threshold \( t = 7.5 \) and the same prompt, which combines system instructions (Appendix~\ref{sec:prompt_sys_instr}) and dialogue history (Appendix~\ref{sec:prompt_dialogue_history}), followed by the user question. The prompt-only baseline achieves a distractor accuracy of 0.282 and an on-topic accuracy of 0.938, which results in an overall score of 0.610. Since the \textit{Prompt Only} method does not use steering, \( L \) and \textit{Steer @} settings are not applicable. This result highlights the baseline model's limited ability to handle distractor inputs effectively.


On the other hand, the application of the steering vector significantly improves distractor accuracy, with the highest improvement observed at \( L = 16 \) and \textit{Steer @} = 15, which reaches 0.810 (+0.529). The highest overall accuracy is achieved at \( L=16 \) and \textit{Steer @} = 16, with an overall accuracy of 0.802 (+0.192). This setting also maintains the highest on-topic accuracy (0.895). Overall, our method achieves a notable increase in overall accuracy and the largest improvement in distractor accuracy while minimizing losses in on-topic accuracy.



Comparing the different \( L\) settings, we observe that on-topic accuracy degrades more in the \( L = 19 \) setting, while distractor accuracy improves similarly in both cases. As a result, overall performance is generally higher in the \( L = 16 \) configuration. This aligns with the entropy distribution differences shown in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy_violin}, where layer 16 exhibits a clearer separation between distractor and on-topic entropy values. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of entropy scaling is influenced by the degree of entropy separation at different layers.

\section{Discussion}

This section discusses the impact of entropy-based coefficient scaling, generalization across models and tasks, and layer-wise entropy patterns across domains. 

\subsection{Effect of Entropy-based Scaling}
Figure~\ref{fig:threshold} illustrates the effect of entropy-based scaling on topic adherence across different threshold values \( t \). Here, \texttt{Vanilla} refers to applying the steering vector with a fixed coefficient (\( C_{\text{max}} \)) without dynamic scaling. \texttt{Vanilla} achieves an overall accuracy of 0.75, exhibiting strong distractor performance (0.80) but lower on-topic accuracy (0.70).

However, EnSToM demonstrates a clear performance improvement over \texttt{Vanilla} setting. At low thresholds (\( t = 2, 4 \)), on-topic accuracy peaks (0.95), but distractor accuracy drops significantly (0.30–0.32). In contrast, higher thresholds (\( t = 7.5, 8 \)) achieve the best overall accuracy (0.80) by balancing distractor handling (0.71–0.76) with minimal on-topic degradation (0.84–0.89). Beyond this range (\( t = 9 \)), distractor accuracy returns to baseline, while on-topic performance declines (0.72), indicating that exceeding the optimal threshold compromises scenario adherence. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of entropy-based scaling in maintaining topic consistency while minimizing trade-offs.



\subsection{Cross Architecture Generalization}
To evaluate the generalizability of EnSToM beyond the Llama family, we conduct experiments on Minstral-8B-Instruct-2410. Table~\ref{tab:ministral} presents the results of EnSToM~($L=28$ and $t=3.0$)\footnote{Systematically selected based on the entropy distribution.}. Without entropy-based scaling (\textit{Prompt Only}), the model exhibits strong on-topic accuracy (0.98) but struggles with distractor handling (0.25), leading to a low overall accuracy (0.62). Applying EnSToM at layers 17 and 18, however, significantly improves distractor accuracy (+0.40 and +0.38, respectively) while maintaining competitive on-topic performance. The best overall accuracy (0.76) is achieved at layer 18, which confirms EnSToM’s effectiveness across different model architectures.

\subsection{Task-level Generalization}
% Figure 추가 -> dev_mode_v2 + harmful prompt / harmless prompt
In order to assess task-level generalization abilities of the proposed model, we shift to the jailbreak defense task\footnote{Dataset construction details are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:jailbreak}.}. Pilot tests reveal that jailbreak attacks were successful most of the time. This means that the model can only generate unsafe responses. However, the model is able to distinguish between harmful and harmless content due to entropy differences at layer 33\footnote{Layer 33 was selected based on the maximally observed difference between harmful and harmless entropy distributions across all layers} (Figure~\ref{fig:entropy_jailbreak}). While refusal-based steering vectors alone were ineffective, these findings suggest the potential for adapting EnSToM to jailbreak defense tasks. 

\subsection{Layer-wise Entropy Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

Prior studies \cite{li2025safety,azaria-mitchell-2023-internal,chuang2024dola} have highlighted that intermediate layers significantly influence the generation process in large language models. Specifically, in the LLaMA-2-7B-chat model used in our study, \citet{li2025safety} demonstrates a clear transition in token attention across intermediate layers: initial layers predominantly capture syntactic tokens, middle layers (e.g., layer 16) shift attention towards semantically crucial tokens, and deeper layers (e.g., layers 19–20) further distribute attention onto tokens with secondary semantic roles.

In our experimental setup—comprising a system instruction, dialogue history, and user query—we observe a similar attention dynamic influencing entropy distributions. At layer 16, distractor queries, semantically incongruent with the dialogue context and system instruction, attract highly focused attention on their unique tokens. This focused attention activates fewer logits, resulting in significantly lower entropy. Conversely, on-topic queries, contextually aligned with the instruction and dialogue history, maintain attention broadly distributed across multiple contextually relevant tokens. This broader activation leads to higher entropy values compared to distractors.

Interestingly, this relationship reverses at deeper layers (e.g., layers 19–20). Here, distractor queries experience increased entropy as attention disperses onto additional semantically relevant tokens beyond the initial focus. Meanwhile, on-topic queries exhibit stable entropy, reflecting sustained distributed attention across the context.

Moreover, this entropy pattern consistently emerges across various domains, as Figure~\ref{fig:mean_domain_layer} illustrates. Distractor inputs consistently exhibit lower entropy at layer 16 and higher entropy at layers 18–20 relative to on-topic inputs, regardless of domain variations. This cross-domain consistency—further supported by our domain-shift experiments detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:cross-domain}—underscores the robustness of our observations and indicates a generalizable mechanism in the model’s internal processing.

These findings align well with established understandings of layer specialization in LLMs \cite{gera-etal-2023-benefits}: lower layers encode syntactic information, intermediate layers encode semantic significance, and higher layers integrate these semantic and contextual representations. Thus, our entropy analysis provides empirical evidence for how intermediate layers differentially process distractor versus on-topic inputs, highlighting layer-specific functional roles and emphasizing the practical applicability of entropy-based methods in detecting semantic consistency within dialogues.

% \subsection{Analysis of the Entropy Trends}
% Prior works \cite{li2025safety,azaria-mitchell-2023-internal,chuang2024dola} have shown that intermediate layers play a key role in the generation process of large language models.

% In particular, for the LLaMA-2-7B-chat model used in our study, \citet{li2025safety} reports that when given an input like "How to make a bomb", the model initially focuses on syntactic tokens like “how” in earlier layers. By Layer 16, however, attention shifts to semantically salient tokens such as “bomb”. In deeper layers (e.g., Layers 19–20), attention is further redistributed to tokens with secondary semantic roles like “make” and “bomb”.

% In our setup—consisting of a system instruction, dialogue history, and user query—a comparable mechanism appears to be at work. For distractor queries, there is a clear semantic deviation from the system instruction and dialogue history. Consequently, attention is highly concentrated on the distractor query tokens at Layer 16, which results in the activation of a smaller set of logits and therefore lower entropy (mean: 6.0). As the model processes deeper layers (e.g., Layers 19–20), attention gradually distributes to other tokens with secondary semantic significance, leading to a broader activation of logits and a corresponding increase in entropy (mean: 8.2).

% In contrast, on-topic queries are semantically consistent with the surrounding context. As a result, even at Layer 16, no single query token stands out as uniquely significant. Instead, attention is distributed across multiple tokens from the system instruction, dialogue history, and user query. This wider distribution activates more logits, which leads to relatively higher entropy (mean: 7.3) compared to distractors. As processing proceeds through later layers (e.g., Layers 19–20), the attention remains broadly distributed, resulting in little change in entropy (remaining around 7.3).

% Thus, at Layer 16, distractors exhibit lower entropy due to sharply focused attention, while on-topic queries show higher entropy from distributed focus. By Layer 19, this relationship reverses; distractors show higher entropy as attention disperses, whereas on-topic queries maintain relatively stable entropy levels.




% \subsection{Cross-Domain Entropy Trends}

% We further compare layer-wise entropy distributions across various domains, where Figure~\ref{fig:mean_domain_layer} illustrates the difference between mean distractor and on-topic entropy per layer. The results indicate a consistent trend of entropy distribution across different domains for the same task inputs. As noted earlier, distractor inputs exhibit noticeably lower entropy than on-topic inputs at layer 16, whereas the opposite is observed at layers 18–20.

% This phenomenon aligns with the well-established understanding that different LLM layers play distinct roles in text generation~\cite{gera-etal-2023-benefits}. Lower layers focus on syntax, middle layers capture semantics, while higher layers integrate these representations to generate coherent and task-specific outputs. The divergence at specific layers suggests that certain layers process distractor and on-topic inputs differently due to their specialized roles. Moreover, this consistent entropy trend, as demonstrated in our domain-shift experiments in Appendix~\ref{sec:cross-domain}, highlights the potential applicability of our method across different domains.

%Notably, the computer troubleshooting domain deviates from this trend at layers 20–25, likely due to its frequent use of specific proper nouns (e.g., "Apple," "Catalina OS," "RAM") rather than general nouns. This suggests that domain-specific terminology may influence entropy patterns in higher layers.%, highlighting the need for further investigation into how different input distributions affect model behavior. Further investigation is required to understand how these layer-specific dynamics influence model responses.


\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced EnSToM, a lightweight and training-free method for enhancing topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems using entropy-scaled steering vectors. By integrating steering vector with an entropy-based coefficient scaling mechanism, our approach dynamically adjusts steering intensity based on the model's generation entropy. Evaluations on the CantTalkAboutThis dataset demonstrated a significant improvement in distractor accuracy while preserving on-topic performance, which results in an increase of overall accuracy.



Furthermore, experiments across different models, domains, and tasks validated the generalizability of our method. Even with limited steering vector samples, EnSToM remained effective, making it suitable for low-resource settings. Additionally, our layer-wise entropy analysis provides valuable insights into LLM behavior, contributing to improved interpretability. These findings support the development of adaptive and scenario-consistent dialogue systems for real-world applications.

\section{Limitations}
Our coefficient scaling approach relies on entropy differences between distractor and normal inputs at specific model layers, with experiments confirming distinct entropy distributions. However, some samples lie within overlapping regions of these distributions, making them hard negatives. Due to their subtle entropy variations, these cases can sometimes produce results opposite to the intended effect, complicating the distinction between on-topic and off-topic inputs. Addressing this issue requires further research.

Additionally, our current method requires manually selecting the entropy extraction layer $L$ and threshold $t$. In this study, we empirically identified layers with the most pronounced distribution differences and manually set the coefficient scaling threshold. For broader applicability, transitioning from a manual to an automated selection process remains an important area for future exploration.

\section{Experimental Details}
In constructing prompts for both distractor and on-topic cases, the system instruction (e.g., in Section~\ref{sec:prompt_sys_instr}) varies depending on the scenario but is always included in its entirety within each prompt. For distractor cases, the prompt incorporates the distractor question along with its corresponding dialogue history, ensuring a complete contextual representation as described in Section~\ref{sec:prompt_dialogue_history}. Conversely, for on-topic cases, the prompt consists of the dialogue history up to the last on-topic user query, and deliberately excludes the distractor and its associated turns to maintain contextual relevance while adhering to the defined scope of the dialogue. This ensures that distractor-specific and on-topic prompts are constructed in alignment with their intended context for the evaluation.

\section{Source Dataset Details}\label{sec:detail_source}
The CantTalkAboutThis dataset comprises data from ten distinct domains: \texttt{banking, computer troubleshooting, education, health, insurance, legal, real estate, taxes, travel}, and \texttt{virtual home assistant}. Each domain consists of approximately 60 scenarios, with 10 to 15 samples per scenario, totaling 650 samples per domain. All data were generated using OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo model. Note that the \texttt{virtual home assistant} domain was excluded from this study, as its data was not accessible during the research period. The CantTalkAboutThis dataset is released under the CC-BY-NC 4.0 license, which permits non-commercial use with proper attribution. In this study, the data was utilized exclusively for research purposes to investigate and improve topic maintenance in dialogue systems.


\section{Jailbreak Dataset Construction}\label{sec:jailbreak}
The Jailbreak dataset is constructed using a prompt injection approach. We utilize the harmless\_test and harmful\_test splits from \citet{arditi2024refusal}, where each sample consists of an instruction and a category, with the instruction representing a harmless or harmful input query. This dataset is released under the Apache-2.0 license, which permits free use, modification, and distribution with proper attribution. Additionally, we select one of the most effective jailbreak prompt templates from \cite{10.1145/3658644.3670388}, named \texttt{Dev Mode v2}.

Let \( t \) be the jailbreak template and \( q \) a query (either harmful \( q_h \) or harmless \( q_s \)). The dataset consists of input pairs \( (t, q) \). The method for computing layer entropy follows the approach described in Section~\ref{sec:layer_entropy_analysis}.

\section{Additional Experiments}\label{sec:add_ex}
\subsection{Impact of Data Size on Steering Effectiveness}
The results in the upper part of Table~\ref{tab:config} demonstrate the impact of sample size on steering vector extraction within the \texttt{banking} domain. With 100 samples, the model achieved distractor accuracies of \(0.81\) at layer 15 and \(0.71\) at layer 16, while on-topic accuracies reached \(0.75\) and \(0.89\) at the same layers.  
Although larger sample sizes provide greater stability, EnSToM remains effective even with as few as 10 samples. At this reduced sample size, distractor accuracies were \(0.74\) and \(0.67\), while on-topic accuracies reached \(0.85\) and \(0.90\) at layers 15 and 16, respectively.  
These results indicate that while increasing the sample size enhances steering precision, the method maintains effectiveness even with limited data, underscoring its applicability in low-resource settings.


\subsection{Cross-Domain Performance Analysis}\label{sec:cross-domain}
The results in Table~\ref{tab:config} also demonstrate the cross-domain applicability of the proposed method. Although the steering vector is extracted from a different domain, it is able to effectively improve topic adherence in the \texttt{banking} domain test set. This indicates that domain-specific adjustments are unnecessary for robust performance. 

These findings suggest that the steering vector captures a generalizable refusal mechanism rather than relying on domain-dependent features. By encapsulating a universal strategy for handling distractor inputs, our approach ensures adaptability across different domains with minimal modifications, which reinforces its practical utility in diverse applications.

\section{Variance Analysis of Steering Vectors}
\label{sec:variance_analysis}

We conducted a detailed variance analysis to evaluate the stability and effectiveness of the steering vectors used in our experiments. Table~\ref{tab:variance_steering_vectors} presents per-layer statistics, including the variance, mean L2 norm, and the relative variance ($\sqrt{\text{Var}}$/L2, calculated as the square root of variance divided by the mean L2 norm) of steering vectors derived from 100 sample pairs.

The results indicate that although higher layers naturally exhibit larger absolute variances due to increased L2 norms, the $\sqrt{\text{Var}}$/L2 value remains consistently low, ranging from 0.0120 to 0.0156. This suggests that the normalized mean vector, derived from 100 samples, effectively suppresses noise.

\section{Analysis of Steering Coefficient Distribution}
\label{sec:coefficient_analysis}

To better understand the behavior of our entropy-based steering mechanism, we analyzed the actual distribution of the steering coefficient $C$ across distractor and on-topic samples. Table~\ref{tab:coeff_combined} present the proportion of samples falling into different $C$ ranges, along with their corresponding classification accuracy.

For distractor samples, which typically require a higher $C$ to effectively steer the model's response, the majority (82.5\%) were assigned $C \geq 1.0$. These samples achieved an accuracy of 0.753, outperforming prompt-only baselines, although still trailing behind the performance seen in on-topic cases. A small portion of distractor samples received lower coefficients ($C < 1.0$), which corresponded with substantially reduced accuracy.

In contrast, on-topic samples, which benefit from lower steering strength, showed a more diverse distribution: 45.8\% were assigned $C < 0.5$, and another 40.2\% received $C \geq 1.0$. Despite a considerable number of on-topic samples being over-steered, the model maintained strong performance with nearly 0.80 accuracy overall. This suggests a certain robustness in handling on-topic queries even under stronger-than-optimal steering.

These results highlight that distractor samples are more sensitive to $C$ than on-topic ones, supporting the motivation for dynamically selecting $C$ based on entropy, rather than using a static value.





\section{Case Study}
\subsection{Effect of the Size of Coefficient}\label{sec:coefficient}
Table~\ref{tab:coefficient} presents the impact of different coefficient values (1, 3, 5) on steering vector application. When the coefficient is set to 1, the model correctly refuses distractor queries. However, as the coefficient increases (3, 5), undesirable behaviors emerge, such as meaningless word repetition (e.g., "initials initials ...") or excessive newline characters ("\textbackslash n \textbackslash n ..."). These results highlight the necessity of selecting an appropriate maximum coefficient to ensure stable and coherent responses.



\subsection{Generation Examples} This section provides examples of model-generated responses to both distractor and on-topic scenarios. Table~\ref{tab:sample_generation} showcases responses categorized as \textit{Exemplary Generation} and \textit{Faulty Generation}, illustrating how the model handles different contexts. For distractor scenarios, \textit{Exemplary Generation} responses demonstrate the model’s ability to refuse off-topic questions while maintaining the scope of the scenario, whereas \textit{Faulty Generation} responses engage with irrelevant queries. Similarly, for on-topic scenarios, \textit{Exemplary Generation} responses provide relevant and accurate answers, while \textit{Faulty Generation} responses fail to address the user’s query or deviate from the scenario’s focus.


\section{Prompts Used in the Study}\label{sec:prompt}
The prompts used for response generation are shown in Sections ~\ref{sec:prompt_sys_instr} and ~\ref{sec:prompt_dialogue_history}, while the prompt employed in the GPT-4o evaluation is outlined in Section~\ref{sec:prompt_eval}.
